# backpack-app

This is an web application where you can organize your backpack for hiking trips.
Users can sign up to create an account which allows them to add items to their backpack. 
They can add the individual weight of the items and the app sums up the weight of all the items in the backpack.
So you're always sure not to carry more the you can and there's alwayys room for optimization.
