# backpack-app

This is an web application where you can organize your backpack for hiking trips.
Users can sign up to create an account which allows them to add items to their backpack. 
They can add the individual weight of the items and the app sums up the weight of all the items in the backpack.
So you're always sure not to carry more the you can and there's always room for optimization.

MyTent was realized with:

React
MongoDB
Express
Node JS

The authentication of the app is secured by technologies such as JsonWebTokens, Bcrypt and HTTP-only cookies. 
In the frontend I'll be using react hooks and the context API to deal with the state management of the user authentication.
